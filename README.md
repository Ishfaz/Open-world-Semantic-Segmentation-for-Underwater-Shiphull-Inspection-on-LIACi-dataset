# Open-world Semantic Segmentation for Underwater Shiphull Inspection

This project implements an open-world semantic segmentation framework for underwater ship hull inspection, adapting the approach from recent advances in autonomous driving to address the unique challenges of underwater imagery analysis.

## Overview

The system utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to perform both traditional semantic segmentation and novel defect detection on underwater ship hull imagery. The implementation achieves a mean IoU of 50.9% across 11 classes while maintaining the ability to identify unknown anomalies.

### Key Features

- Dual-decoder architecture with ResNet34 backbone
- Open-world semantic segmentation capabilities
- Specialized loss functions for underwater imagery 
- Support for both known defect detection and novel anomaly identification
- Comprehensive feature space organization through contrastive learning

## Dataset

The project uses the LIACI dataset from SINTEF Ocean, which includes:
- 1893 annotated images
- 11 semantic classes 
- Diverse underwater conditions and defect types

10. Corrosion
11. Sea chest grating
